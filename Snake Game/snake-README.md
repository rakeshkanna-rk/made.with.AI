# Snake Game with Python and Pygame

This markdown document provides a Python code snippet for creating a simple Snake game using the Pygame library. The code includes features such as a snake that increases in length when it eats an apple, a boundary for game over conditions, and a basic game loop.

The document also includes three prompts that were used to guide the development of the code. Each prompt addresses specific aspects of the game, such as graphics, gameplay logic, and user interface elements like a scoreboard and a "Try Again" button.

Please note that the code presented here is for educational purposes and may require further refinement and customization for a complete game. Additionally, a disclaimer is included at the beginning of the document, highlighting that AI-generated content


## ChatGPT Promtes

### Prompts I used
